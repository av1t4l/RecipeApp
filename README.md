# RecipeApp
A recipe storage app that gathers nutritional information on your recipes.


*Created for iPhone Software Engineering using swift 4 and storyboards.*

### NOTE:
It uses the EDAMAM Nutrition Analysis API and requires an app id and an API key. Set the `APP_ID` and `API_KEY` environment variables accordingly.  

Because of this API, a recipe must contain valid ingredient names to be created successfully eg: `milk` `egg`
